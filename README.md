# Connect Four Game

A simple command-line implementation of the classic Connect Four game in C++. 

## About the Game

Connect Four is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Compile the `connect_four.cpp` file.
4. Run the executable.

## Gameplay

The game prompts players to input the column number (1-7) to place their respective tokens. The program checks for valid moves, displays the current state of the board, and declares the winner when a player successfully connects four tokens in a row.
